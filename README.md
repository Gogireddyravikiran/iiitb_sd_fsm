Sequence Detector Using Moore State Machine
Here I have implemented the Moore finite state machine sequence detector “1011”. Where the Moore finite state machine keeps detecting the digital input and the output of the fsm goes only high when the sequence is detected I.e., “1011”. In Moore fsm output depends only on the present state logic but not on the present input So in this 
case we need the extra state to represent the ouput.Here when the sequence is detected at the input the output will represent as a 1. Whereas the next state logic is dependent upon the present input also on the present state. Here I used “1011” as a pattern when the input sequence is detected as a 1011 then the we see output as 1. 
Here I performed a overlapping sequence to detect the pattern “1011”.
